# Getting Started
Firstly setup a folder (if none exists) under 'Programdata' in your C: drive. The name of the folder should be 'SUPERHOT'. (if it already exists, don't make one)
Next, create a folder called 'System', and copy the FileStructure text file I've provodied you with there. It'll make the game playable, and force changes into piOS upon launching SuperHot.

Don't forget to down my .DLL with the changes so the file can be read.
